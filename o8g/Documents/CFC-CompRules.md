# Card Fighters' Clash Comprehensive Rules

*These rules are effective as of December 20, 2015.*

## Introduction

This document is designed for people who wants to deep into the rules of the Card Fighters' Clash (CFC) game. They explain the internal mechanics of the game and they add clarification for some obscure parts. You won’t usually need to refer to them except in specific cases.

For casual play you’ll find what you need in the [CFC rulebook](CFC-Rules.html).

This document includes a series of numbered rules followed by a glossary. Many of the numbered rules are divided into subrules, and each separate rule and subrule of the game has its own number. (Note that subrules skip the letters “l” and “o” due to potential confusion with the numbers “1” and “0”.)

Finally, no matter how detailed the rules are, there will be situations with specific cards that will require a precise answer. If you have questions, you can look at the [FAQ](CFC-FAQ.html) page or you can get the answers at https://github.com/raohmaru/CFC.
