# OCTGN Gameplay

## Starting a New Game
The game expects you to be playing on a two sided table. When you host a game of Card Fighters' Clash, please ensure that in the Pre-Game Lobby, the "Two Sided Table" option is enabled.

The game can be played with 2 players.

Once the game is started you will need to load your deck. Unless you have turned off Play automation, when you load a deck the game will automate player setup. If you have turned automation off you can activate this function manually using the "Setup game" option from the table menu or by using the <span class=kb>Ctrl</span>+<span class=kb>Shift</span>+<span class=kb>S</span> shortcut. This will
- Check your deck
- Shuffle your deck
- Draw 5 cards
- Start the game

## Playing the Game
The best way to learn how to play CFC is by playing the videogame [SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters' Clash 2 Expand Edition](http://neogeo.freeplaytech.com/svc-2/). If you don't have a Neo Geo Pocket Color, or you aren't one of the lucky owners of a Card Fighters' Clash 2 cartridge, you can try the [CFC2 English patch](http://cfc2english.blogspot.com.es/).

Additionally, the guy from [Card Fighters Project](https://www.cardfighterproject.com/) has a [nice video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuasJzdpiTc) playing the game with real cards while they explain the rules.

### Turns
CFC is a turn-based game. Each player takes turns alternatively.

Each turn is divided in seven phases. To move to the next phase you can press <span class=kb>Tab</span> key or functions keys <span class=kb>F1</span> to <span class=kb>F7</span>.

Once you are in the last phase of your turn (the Cleanup phase), moving to the next phase will pass automatically the turn to your opponent.

Please note that if automations are on, it's important to go through all phases, due to some automated tasks are performed on every phase to easy the gameplay.

### Playing Cards
To play a card from your hand you can double click on it, then the game will take care of the rest (if Play automation is on).

### Activating Abilities
To activate an ability or effect of a card on the table, double click on it. Cards have automated effects that the plugin will apply automatically; if they don't, you will need to apply them manually.

Automatic <span class="ab ab-auto">‚óè</span> abilities are applied automatically after playing the card or triggered after a phase change or certains events.

### Attacking
You can attack in the Attack phase by double click on a card, or by pressing <span class=kb>Ctrl</span>+<span class=kb>A</span> over a character card, or <span class=kb>Ctrl</span>+<span class=kb>Alt</span>+<span class=kb>A</span> to join an attacker and do a United Attack.

Defending player can counter an attacking character in the Counterattack phase by targeting the attacking character (<span class=kb>Shift</span>+<span class=kb>Left click</span>), and then double click on a defending character card or press <span class=kb>Ctrl</span>+<span class=kb>B</span> while hovering ta defending character card.

## The Actions & Keyboard Shortcuts
To play and go through OCTGN, you can use the mouse to interact with the game objects (table, cards, hand, deck), and the contextual menu (right click) and/or the keyboard to activate actions such as drawing cards, moving between phases or flip a coin. When an action is activated some automations take place to assist you and play faster.

In OCTGN there are two kinds of actions: *group actions* and *card actions*. To activate a group action, you need to move the cursor to an empty spot of the group and then right click on the mouse to show a menu with the available options, or press action's keyboard shortcut.

To activate a card action, move the cursor to a card and then right click to show the menu or press the keyboard shortcut.

The keyboard shortcuts are shown along to an option in the contextual menu.
