# Card Fighters' Clash FAQ

### What are the differences with the video game *SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters' Clash 2 Expand Edition*
The mechanics of CFC are the same as the video game, but with the following differences:

+ Character cards can have negative SP values, like Action and Reaction cards. To play a character with negative SP you must spend that amount from your SP.
+ Character cards have a subtype (Agent, Boss, Fighter, Pilot, Samurai...).
+ Character cards don't show a list of names of characters it accepts as backups. Instead they show a list of character subtypes.
+ Players own an additional Removed Pile, where their cards removed form the game are put.
