# Deck Building

To play Card Fighter’s Clash each player needs their own deck of cards. However, building a deck can be a daunting process with so many cards to choose from. You will find next some hints than can help you in the process.

## How to Build a CFC Deck

### Character / Action / Reaction Balance
Character cards are used to gain SP and to attack the opponent. Action and Reaction cards allows you to interact with the game, but you need to pay the amount of SP listed in the card.

If your deck contains too many Character cards your ring will quickly fill up and you will be out of options to play more cards, unless a slot is freed. You need Action and Reaction cards to allow you to continue interacting with the game. However, if your deck has too many Action or Reaction cards, you won’t have enough SP to be able to play these cards.

**A deck should contain anywhere from 17 to 21 Action or Reaction cards**, mainly to avoid getting a dead starting hand. A dead starting hand is a hand without any Character cards, so that you can’t actually play anything (that has a negative SP value). Below is a chart of the number of non-character cards in a deck and the corresponding percent chance of getting a starting hand with non-character cards.

| Non-character cards &nbsp; | Dead starting hand |
|--|--|
| 0 | 0.00% |
| 10 | 0.01% |
| 15 | 0.14% |
| 16 | 0.21% |
| 17 | 0.29% |
| 18 | 0.40% |
| 19 | 0.55% |
| 20 | 0.73% |
| 21 | 0.96% |
| 22 | 1.24% |
| 23 | 1.59% |
| 24 | 2.01% |
| 25 | 2.51% |
| 30 | 6.72% |
| 35 | 15.32% |
| 40 | 31.06% |
| 50 | 100.0% |

As you can see, the likelihood drawing a dead hand when running up to 21 non-character cards is safely under 1%.

### SP Value

Action and Reaction cards are an essential part of the game, but in order to play an Action or Reaction card, you need to pay the amount of SP listed on that card. To get SP, you play Character cards and then you get the amount of SP listed on the card.

Thus it is important to ensure that **your deck produces the amount of SP that you need to play non-character cards**, by including enough characters to produce enough SP.

## Deck Restrictions

Some restrictions apply when creating a deck to encourage a fair battle between players.

### Deck Size

**A deck must contain 50 cards**. The game plugin checks for the number of cards after a deck has been loaded. If the size is different than 50, a notification will appear for all players warning about the invalid deck. However the game won’t stop you from playing with a deck of any size, regardless of the warning.

### Number of Copies of a Card

A deck can contain any type of card but **there can’t be more than three copies of any single card with the same name** (_for example, a deck can contain three cards named “Akuma”, another three cards named “Shinjin Akuma” but not four cards named “Zero Akuma”_).

## Pre-Built Decks

After the installation of the game plugin in OCTGN some pre-built decks are available, which you can load in the Deck Editor or in-game.
