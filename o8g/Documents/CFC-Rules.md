# Card Fighters' Clash Rulebook
This document is designed for people who want to start learning the rules and gameplay of Card Fighters' Clash. For a more advanced set of rules and further explanations, please see the [Comprehensive rules](CFC-CompRules.html) document.

## Introduction
Card Fighters' Clash (we will refer to as CFC) is a collectible card game for two players based on SNK Playmore’s video game [SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters' Clash 2 Expand Edition](http://neogeo.freeplaytech.com/svc-2/). Players try to defeat each other in a battle playing powerful characters based on Capcom and SNK Playmore video games. Characters have unique abilities that can dramatically change the course of the game, and the character's KI energy is manifested in the form of Soul Points, which can be used to attack the opponent or to play Action cards and Reaction cards –they add exciting effects to the battle that can be played even in opponent's turn.

Players start the game (in CFC every game is a battle!) with a deck of cards. A deck may contain any number Character, Action or Reaction cards, but it can't have more than three copies of any single card with the same name. Each player shuffles his or her deck and draws an initial hand of 5 cards, and then they are ready to fight.

In their respective turn, players draw cards from his or her deck, play cards from his or her hand and attack the opponent (in CFC we refer to an opponent as an "enemy") with the characters he has in play. The the enemy has the opportunity to counterattack with his characters or by playing Reaction cards.

The battle ends when a player's HP (Hit Points or player's life) drops to 0 or less, that is when dealt damage by a character or by the effect of a card. But also a player can lose the battle if he runs out of cards in his or her deck. So be ready to strike hard and block enemy's attacks and you will have a chance to win the battle.

Round 1, start!

## The Game Board
![Game board zones](imgs/gameboard-1.jpg)

The game board of CFC has two different zones: the Game Area (**1**) (also called **Arena**) where the players plays their cards, and the Piles Zone where the card stacks are (the Deck, the Discards Pile and the Removed Pile).

The Arena is divided into two parts, one for each player, and they are called the **Ring** (**2**). The Ring is where the players places their character cards, and always in an empty slot (**3**). In a regular CFC game, each Ring has four slots, that means that players can play up to four characters by placing the cards in an empty slot.

When a player attacks with their characters, these cards are moved to the Attack Line (**4**) by moving them one space forward (but without invading the other player's ring). If the other player blocks an attack (he counterattacks) with a character, he moves that card to its Attack Line in front of the attacking card.

At the end of a turn, character cards are moved back to their slot.

### Deck
Players need a deck (**5**) of at least 50 cards to play CFC. A deck can contain any type of card but with the following limitation: it can't have more than three copies of any single card with the same name (for example, a deck can contain three cards named "Akuma" and another three cards named "Shinjin Akuma").

When a player draws a card, he must draw from the top of his deck (unless an effect says the opposite).

### Discards Pile
When a character is KO'ed (that is, his Battle Points lowers to 0 or by an effect) it's moved from a Ring to its controller Discard Pile (**6**), faced up.
Action cards and Reaction cards go to the Discard Pile as well, after their effects are resolved.

Any player may look at a Discards Pile, but the order of the cards can't be changed.

### Removed Pile
Some effects (like Fellowship) send cards to the Removed Pile. Cards in this pile are considered out of the game to any effect.

Removed cards are kept face up and may be examined by any player at any time.

### Hand
Cards held by each player are called the Hand (**7**). When starting a battle, players draw 5 cards from their deck.

There's no limit on the number of cards a player can have in his hand.

## The Cards
By playing cards players can bring into the battle powerful fighters and effects to defeat the opponent.

### Anatomy of a Card
![Parts of a card](imgs/card-parts-1.jpg)

1. Card name
2. **Battle Points (BP)**. It represents a character's attack power and its strength. When a character is dealt damage, its BP is reduced by that number of damage points.
   If the BP lowers to zero, that character is KO'ed and goes to the discard pile.
3. **Soul Points (SP)**. It represents Ki energy in battles. Players can spend SP to play Action and Reaction cards, and to make United Attacks.  
   When a character card enters the Ring, its controller gains the SP listed in that card.

### Card Types
A card has one type, that tells when it can be played and what happens to the card after it's played.

#### Character
Characters are powerful cards
that are placed in your ring.

Characters can attack and deal
damage to the enemy, or they
can protect against attacking
characters.

Players can only play one
CHA card per turn.

#### Action
Action cards offers useful
effects that affects the game.

AC cards have a "COST", a
number of SP a player must spend
to play that card.

Players may play any number of
AC cards in their turn.

#### Reaction
Reaction cards are like AC cards
but that can be only played
during enemy's Attack phase.

RE cards have a "COST", a
number of SP a player must spend
to play that card.

Players may play any number of
RE cards in enemy's attack.


▲ ABILITY

The ▲ ABILITY is an effect that
is activated when that character
enters the ring.




■ ABILITY

The ■ ABILITY is an effect that
you can activate only in your
Main phase.
When activated that character
enters the freeze state.

Characters just entered the ring
can't activate a ■ ABILITY in
that turn.




● ABILITY

The ● ABILITY is an effect that
is always active as long as that
character is on the ring.

Whenever a character with a
● ABILITY takes part in a United
Attack, that ability is nullified
until the end of the turn.


## Game Structure

## Attacking

## Blocking



HP

Hit Points represents each
players' life.

When a player is dealt damage,
he loses that much HP.
A player loses the game when
his HP drops to 0.

Maximum HP value is 9900.




RING

Characters enter and fight in
a field called the "RING".

Players can place up to 3 CHA
cards in their ring.




TURN

A "TURN" is a part of the game
where a player takes actions
before moving on to the next
turn.

A "BATTLE" is when players
take turns in sequence until
someone wins.




PHASES

A "PHASE" refers to the parts of
a turn.
A turn consists of 4 phases.

1. Activate Phase
2. Draw Phase
3. Main Phase
4. Counterattack Phase

See Phases 1 - 4 for details.




ACTIVATE PHASE (phase 1)

All characters in your ring are
unfrozen.

(Certain characters may stay
frozen due an effect.)




DRAW PHASE (phase 2)

You draw a card from your deck.

If you can't draw a card because
there's no cards in your deck,
you lose.

Some effects may cause to skip
this phase (and cards can't
be drawn).




MAIN PHASE (phase 3)

You can do any of the following
actions in any order.

- Place a CHA card (once only)
- Back-up a character (1 only)
- Activate a ■ ability
- Play an AC card
- Make an Attack

Once the Attack begins, this
phase ends and the next
phase begins.




COUNTERATTACK PHASE (phase 4)

Enemy decides which, if any,
of his unfrozen characters
will counterattack the
attacking characters.

When this phase ends, the turn
ends and enemy's turn begins.





ATTACK

Players can attack with their
characters. Not countered
characters deal damage equal to
its BP to enemy.

Any number of unfrozen
characters can attack, and only
if they were on your ring when
the turn began.



UNITED ATTACK 1

A UNITED ATTACK is when two
or more characters attack
together at once and not
separately.

DOUBLE UNITED ATTACK costs
5 SP, and TRIPLE UNITED ATTACK
costs 10 SP.




UNITED ATTACK 2

UNITED ATTACKS also deals
PIERCING DAMAGE.

Unlike single attacks, if the
total BP of the attacking
characters is higher than the
BP of the character that counters,
this BP difference is dealt as
damage to the enemy.




COUNTERATTACK

A COUNTERATTACK happens when
a character counters an enemy
attacking character.

A character can only counter
attack one attack. An attack
can only be countered by one
single character.

Frozen characters can't
counterattack.




FREEZE

A character in a "freeze" state
can't attack, counterattack
or activate ■ abilities.

Some abilities and effects can
result in frozen characters.




BACK-UP 1

"BACK-UP" is linking a
character in your ring with a
CHA card in your hand.

The character receiving
back-up raises its BP by 300 pts,
regardless of the back-up
character's BP.

Note that back-up combinations
are predetermined for each
character.




BACK-UP 2

Characters that just entered the
ring and frozen characters can't
receive back-ups.
Can't back-up more than 1 time
per turn.

Characters used for back-up
are not in the ring.
If a backed-up character leaves
the ring, all their back-ups
characters are discarded.








OTHER RULES

The first player will have
no DRAW PHASE during their
first turn.
