# Card Fighters' Clash plugin for OCTGN
Card Fighters' Clash is a card game for two players based on SNK Playmoreâ€™s video game
[SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters' Clash 2 Expand Edition](http://neogeo.freeplaytech.com/svc-2/).
Players try to defeat each other playing powerful characters from video games licensed by Capcom and SNK Playmore.

This repository contains a game definition plugin for the free card game engine [Online Card and Tabletop Gaming Network (OCTGN)](http://octgn.net/).
This plugin allows online playing and creation of CFC decks.

Official plugin site: https://cardfightersclash.wordpress.com/

## Development
The project uses [Rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake) to automate some tasks, available through the following commands:

| Command            | Description        |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `rake build`       | Builds a .o8g and a .nupkg file from the game definition files using o8build.exe. |
| `rake deploy`      | Builds and moves the NUPKG file to the OCTGN LocalFeed directory. |
| `rake copy`        | Copies python files to the game's script folder under OCTGN's games database folder. Useful when debugging your game along with the built-in functionality to reload python scripts. |
| `rake test`        | Verifies the files as a valid game definition. |
| `rake versionbump` | Increases the build number by 1 in the definition.xml file. |
| `rake octgn`       | Runs OCTGN in dev mode, in the table view with the CFC plugin loaded. |
| `rake docs`        | Converts Markdown documents in Documents/ folder into HTML files. |

Use [bundler](http://bundler.io/) to install the dependencies listed in the [Gemfile](https://github.com/raohmaru/CFC/blob/master/Gemfile).

## Templates
CFC card templates (and sets of cards) are created and managed using [Magic Set Editor 2](http://magicseteditor.sourceforge.net/) software and a [custom template](https://github.com/raohmaru/CFC-MSE2).  
The card template is ported as an [OCTGN proxy card](https://github.com/octgn/OCTGN/wiki/ProxyGenerator), hence the image packs only contains the illustration.
